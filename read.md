This is for php pros who like not using a framework. I mean it does contain website stuff out of box and db and all that crap
but like you still gotta do fetch obj and stuff but like why even use laravel if its that easy doesnt that just make it laggy
plus vuejs and artisan are pretty sh but yeah also the fact that vuejs actually works out of the box for one page faked with a php mvc
then this is the go-to framework that all websites that use php need. its not even a framework its more like a programmers sdk
